# Why "Build and publish to Docker Hub" is Skipped

## 🔍 The Reason

The Docker Hub job has a condition that **only runs on version tags**, not on regular branch pushes.

## 📋 The Condition

Looking at `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

```yaml
docker-hub:
  name: Build and publish to Docker Hub
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: test
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')  # 👈 This is the condition!
```

This means:
- ✅ **Runs:** When you push a tag like `v1.0.0`, `v2.3.4`, etc.
- ❌ **Skips:** When you push to a branch like `main`, `master`, etc.

## 🎯 Why This Design?

This is **intentional** and follows best practices:

1. **Semantic Versioning:** Only publish Docker images for tagged releases
2. **Control:** Prevents publishing every development commit
3. **Stability:** Ensures only stable, versioned code gets published
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Doesn't waste build time on every push

## ✅ How to Trigger Docker Hub Publishing

### Option 1: Create and Push a Version Tag (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a version tag
git tag v1.0.0

# Push the tag (this triggers Docker publishing)
git push origin v1.0.0

# Or push all tags at once
git push --tags
```

### Option 2: Push an Existing Tag

```bash
# If you already created a tag locally
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🔄 Current Workflow Behavior

| Event | Test Job | Docker Hub Job | Artifactory Job | Render Deploy |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Push to `main` | ✅ Runs | ❌ Skipped | ❌ Skipped | ✅ Runs (if secrets set) |
| Push tag `v1.0.0` | ✅ Runs | ✅ Runs | ✅ Runs (if secrets set) | ✅ Runs (if secrets set) |
| Pull Request | ✅ Runs | ❌ Skipped | ❌ Skipped | ❌ Skipped |

## 🛠️ Options to Change This Behavior

If you want Docker Hub publishing on every push (not recommended for production):

### Option A: Remove the Condition (Publishes on All Pushes)

Edit `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and remove the `if:` condition:

```yaml
docker-hub:
  name: Build and publish to Docker Hub
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: test
  # Remove this line: if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This will publish Docker images on every push, which may:
- Create many images
- Use more build minutes
- Publish potentially unstable code

### Option B: Publish on Main Branch + Tags

Change the condition to allow main branch AND tags:

```yaml
docker-hub:
  name: Build and publish to Docker Hub
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: test
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
```

### Option C: Keep Current Behavior (Recommended)

Keep the current setup and use tags for releases:
- ✅ Tests run on every push (fast feedback)
- ✅ Docker images only published on releases (controlled)
- ✅ Follows best practices

## 🧪 Testing the Docker Hub Job Locally

To test what would happen with a tag push:

```bash
# Create a test tag locally
git tag v1.0.0

# Test with act (requires secrets)
act push --eventpath .github/test-event-tag.json \
  --job docker-hub \
  --secret-file .act-secrets \
  --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

## ✅ Quick Checklist

To make Docker Hub publishing work:

- [ ] Add GitHub secrets: `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_TOKEN`
- [ ] Create and push a version tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
- [ ] Watch the GitHub Actions workflow run
- [ ] Verify image appears on Docker Hub

## 📊 Summary

**Current Status:** 
- Job is working correctly ✅
- Skipped because no version tag was pushed ✅
- This is expected behavior ✅

**To publish:**
1. Create a tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
2. Push it: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. Watch the workflow publish your image! 🚀
